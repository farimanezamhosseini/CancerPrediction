#Features Used

AGE:

The age of the individual, a continuous variable that is crucial for assessing cancer risk.

GENDER:

A categorical variable indicating the gender of the individual, which may impact health outcomes and risk factors for lung cancer.

LUNG_CANCER:

The target variable indicating the presence or absence of lung cancer, used for classification in the machine learning model.

###Data Preprocessing Steps###

Data Cleaning:

The dataset is checked for null values and duplicates to ensure data quality.

Encoding:

Categorical variables such as GENDER and the target variable LUNG_CANCER are converted into numerical values to facilitate model training.

Feature Scaling:

Continuous features like AGE are standardized to improve model performance.

Handling Class Imbalances:

Oversampling techniques are applied to balance the dataset, ensuring adequate representation of both classes.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations:
Various plots are generated to understand the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable.
Model Development

Training and Testing:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance accurately.

Multiple Algorithms:

Various machine learning algorithms are implemented and fine-tuned for predicting lung cancer risk.

Evaluation Metrics

Performance Evaluation:
The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves to assess its effectiveness in predicting lung cancer risk.

Conclusion
The code provides a comprehensive approach to developing a machine learning model for lung cancer prediction, utilizing health and lifestyle factors to assess individual risk.
